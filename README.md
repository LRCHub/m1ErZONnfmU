# The Devil Wears Prada – Everybody Knows

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
It's always take, take, take,
never give
Finger pointing back at myself
in the mirror
Never get a break from the life
that you live
It is what it is
Is what it is
Maybe I'm guilty
of chasin' the thrills
Never get a break
from the life that you live
You get what you give
You get what you give
I can't get back,
gotta find another path
Maybe this will finally take me home
I can't keep track
of the times I can't relax
Maybe I shouldn't be left alone
And everybody knows
Yeah, everybody knows
I don't wanna wait, wait,
wait for the next
Time when I'm right here,
ready to regret
Nothing is forever,
don't ever forget
It is what it is
Is what it is
Maybe I'm happy,
but that never lasts
I think I need a break
from the ditch that I'm in
You get what you give
You get what you give
I can't get back,
gotta find another path
Maybe this will finally take me home
I can't keep track
of the times I can't relax
Maybe I shouldn't be left alone
And everybody knows
Yeah, everybody knows
And everybody knows
that I'm useless
'Cause I won't go
where the truth is
I'm already on edge,
so rip off the bandage
And show me the damaged parts of me
Parts of me
I can't get back,
gotta find another path
Maybe this will finally take me home
I can't get back,
gotta find another path
Maybe this will finally take me home
Take me home
I can't keep track
of the times I can't relax
Maybe I shouldn't be left alone
Maybe I shouldn't be left alone
And everybody knows
Yeah, everybody knows
And everybody knows
Yeah, everybody knows
